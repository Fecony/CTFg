# CTFg

Configuration for running CTFd with PostgreSQL and Hasura to expose a GraphQL API.

## vision

* integrate hasura with ctfd
    * authentication
    * authorization
    * sensible exposed tables
* extend ctfd with hasura mutations / secondary graphql service
* extend ctfd with frontend pages that use codegen + graphql schema for all types

## dev environment

### docker

#### setup

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml u
```

#### delete including volumes

```
docker-compose down -v
```

### frontend

#### setup

```
cd frontend
# start docker, code generation, and dev server in watch mode
yarn start 
# (optional) populate the ctfd database with some fake data
yarn fakedata
```

#### fetching data

When you add a `gql` tagged query to a source file, graphql-codegen will automatically generate typed Hooks for
performing the query in `generated/graphql.tsx`.

### hasura

```
docker-compose up -d
cd hasura; hasura console --address 127.0.0.1
# use http://127.0.0.1:9695/    
git commit hasura/
```
